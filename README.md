##Architecture

In my full-stack project, I used Express HTML for server-rendered HTML pages, JavaScript for interactivity, and a single-page application (SPA) for dynamic content. SPAs provide a fluid user experience by updating content without page reloads. The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database for flexibility, scalability, and JSON-like document storage. MongoDB allows rapid development with complex data structures and offers good performance for certain use cases. The database choice depends on project needs and the team's familiarity. Each technology serves specific purposes, enhancing frontend functionality and facilitating data management on the backend.

##Functionality
JSON is a data interchange format, while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON serves as a bridge between frontend and backend by exchanging structured data. It enables data transfer and synchronization between the two. Code refactoring in full stack development can improve functionality and efficiency. Backend refactoring can optimize queries and error handling, while frontend refactoring can enhance code structure and UI components. Reusable UI components bring benefits such as code reusability, consistency, and scalability. Testing ensures application correctness and stability.

##Testing
In a full stack application, methods refer to HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) used for request and retrieval of data from backend endpoints. Endpoints are specific URLs that the frontend interacts with to perform actions or retrieve data. Security layers can include authentication and authorization measures, which pose challenges for API testing, requiring strategies to ensure proper testing of secure endpoints.

##Reflection
This course has provided me insight into some of the backend systems that developers use to create web-based applications. While some of the application wasn't created with best practice in mind, the framework provided a starting point for me to become a full stack dev using Mean.
